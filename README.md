# Title: Aflatoxigenic Aspergillus Modulates Aflatoxin-B1 Levels through an Antioxidative Mechanism

DOI: 10.3390/jof9060690


1.0) Data files are "csv" format for use in the R code in file "Antioxidation.R" and are as follows:

i) file "Afla_modulation.csv" - contains aflatoxin levels (based on HPLC results) in ppm (ug/ml. Treatments ('Afl,' 'Spp,' 'Spp+Afl,'Spp+Afl+AOx,' and 'Spp+AOx') are explained in manucript with above heading (1.0), under materials and methods. "Mytox" is either a high-, low-, or non-aflatoxin producer** (explained in materials and methods).

ii) file "Fitness_antioxidant.csv" - contains spore counts (based on Casy Counter instrument) in spores/ml x 10^-6. Treatments (levels of Se - antioxidant, mg/kg) are explained in manucript with above heading (1.0), under materials and methods. "Variant" is either a producer of aflatoxin (toxigenic) or a non-producer of aflatoxin (atoxigenic)**.

iii) file "GenOx.csv" - contains relative expression levels for genes aflD and aflR in two selected high-aflatoxin producing strains (M14F and E33C). Aflatoxin levels (based on HPLC results) are in ppm (ug/g agar). Treatments (AOx) are different concentrations of antioxidant and are explained in manucript with above heading (1.0), under materials and methods.
